    "In the case of our problem--predicting whether it will rain tomorrow--what is the simplest model we could use? We'd need to look at the **base rate frequency**. If we know that, over the course of the year, it rains ~30% of the time, that would be our base rate frequency. If we were to guess that it would be sunny every day of the year, we'd be wrong ~30% of the time, *but we'd be right ~70% of the time.* \n",

Imagine we create a sophisticated model that accurately predicts rain/no rain ~60% of the time; without any other information, we might think, \"That's not too bad, I guess.\" It certainly feels better than *no* information, right? Now think about the base rate frequency model, which achieves an accuracy of **70%** just by guessing the same thing every time. Suddenly, our sophisticated model seems like crap! It tells us we could be doing ~10% better than our fancy model by guessing. This is why we use the base rate frequency as a simple way to test our models.\n",
